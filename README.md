# timetable_allocation
Your `main.py` script is a Flask-based web application designed to manage class scheduling based on user input. It provides a form where users enter the number of classes, sections, and slots, and then redirects them to a results page that generates a schedule using the `findpattern` function from `utility.py`. If the function returns a valid schedule, the app displays it in a structured table using `createtable.html`; otherwise, it shows an error message through `error.html`. The Flask app handles user input via routes (`/` for the form and `/result` for processing) and operates in debug mode for real-time error tracking. This setup ensures an interactive and efficient scheduling system that dynamically generates class timetables. Let me know if you need further improvements or a deeper analysis of `utility.py`.
